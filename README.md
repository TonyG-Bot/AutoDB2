# AutoDB2
A 1.12.1 Vanilla WoW addon that automatically does `/db chests` and `/db rares` for pfQuest users and allows to setup any pfQuest commands to execute after logging in.

# Installation
Install location should be: ..\Interface\AddOns\AutoDB2

**Make sure you remove the "-main" from the "AutoDB2-main" folder so it becomes just "AutoDB2"**

# Usage
Type `/autodb add mines`, `/autodb add taxi horde` etc to automatically execute commands after logging in.
Type `/autodb remove mines`, `/autodb remove chests` etc to remove entry from loading list.
See `/db` for the list of available commands.
Also see AutoDB ingame help: `/autodb help`.
Commands `/db chests` and `/db rares` are enabled by default.
